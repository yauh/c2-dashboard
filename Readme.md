# C2-Dashboard

This is a simple Meteor app that lets you view your rowing activity on a [Concept2 erg](http://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers) (Indoor rowing machine). View it in action at [c2-dashboard.meteor.com](http://c2-dashboard.meteor.com).

## Usage

The app allows you to upload a CSV file generated by the [Concept2 Utility](http://www.concept2.com/service/software/concept2-utility).

## History

This app is a work in progress and still too early to use. Seriously, don't.

## Todo

- Add accounts to keep data separated (show only my data/limited to specific user)
- Fix issue with chart not rendering when using navigation
- Define KPIs
- Aggregate workout data for summary report
- trigger KPI generation during logcard import
- Streamline chart generation
- Paging for logcard data
- Integrate workout data from other sources (e.g. RunKeeper)
